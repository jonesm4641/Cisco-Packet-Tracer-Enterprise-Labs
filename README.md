# Cisco Packet Tracer Networking Labs

This repository contains hands-on networking labs built using **Cisco Packet Tracer** to demonstrate foundational and intermediate networking concepts.

The goal of this repository is to showcase practical skills in network design, configuration, troubleshooting, and validation using Cisco-style workflows.

---

## Objectives

- Practice core networking concepts using Packet Tracer
- Reinforce theory through hands-on configuration
- Develop structured troubleshooting and validation habits
- Build a public portfolio of networking labs

---

## Lab Topics (Planned & In Progress)

- Network fundamentals (OSI, TCP/IP, cabling)
- IP addressing and subnetting
- VLANs and trunking
- Inter-VLAN routing
- Static routing
- Dynamic routing (RIP, OSPF basics)
- DHCP and DNS concepts
- NAT
- ACL fundamentals
- Basic network troubleshooting
