# Cisco Packet Tracer Enterprise Labs

This repository contains a structured series of **Cisco Packet Tracer labs** designed to demonstrate practical networking skills from beginner through advanced levels.

The labs build progressively, simulating the evolution of a small network into a hardened, enterprise-style environment with routing, security controls, and high availability.

---

## Objectives

- Build a strong foundation in Cisco networking concepts
- Apply routing, switching, and security configurations hands-on
- Practice validation and troubleshooting techniques
- Showcase real-world networking workflows in a public portfolio

---

## Lab Progression

### Phase 1 — Network Foundations
- VLAN segmentation and Layer 2 switching
- Inter-VLAN routing using router-on-a-stick
- Centralized DHCP services across VLANs

### Phase 2 — Routing & Perimeter
- Dynamic routing with OSPF (single area)
- NAT/PAT for enterprise edge connectivity
- ACL-based east-west and north-south traffic control

### Phase 3 — Security & Resilience
- Layer 2 switch security hardening
- Site-to-site IPsec VPN connectivity
- High availability gateway design using HSRP

### Phase 4 — Capstone
- Enterprise mini-campus network integrating routing, security, and hardening
